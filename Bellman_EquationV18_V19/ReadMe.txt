# This is a program to implement the Bellman Equation (V-values).
# Based on known trans_probability, rewards and actions we will implement Bellman equation
# to find the required V-value (example V18, V19)

Code: compute_V_values.py

Command Usage: $python compute_V_values.py 18 ---- This calculates V18 value
               $python compute_V_values.py 19 ---- This calculates the V19 value

Sample Output:
$ python compute_V_values.py 18
[ 27.5  26.5   0. ]

$ python compute_V_values.py 19
[ 29.0  28.0   0. ]
Verified the values for V0, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5 and V6 by executing script and matching answer through pen and paper.
